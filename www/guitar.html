		<p>I have a classical acoustic guitar (Yamaha G-228 Classical). Sounds awesome... unfortunately, I am planning to leave germany soon, and so I had to take it back to India while I toil for some more months on western hemisphere.</p>
		<p>Anyway... I am a novice student, and I depend on online tutorials for guidance. Listed are some materials that I found quite helpful.</p>
		<h1>Teaching material</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxR_esEw_xs">Classical Guitar: Positioning</a> - Start with this. Almost all classical guitar players use this positioning.<br/>
			Once comfortable with the positioning, look for other lessons by the same guy (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Lutemann">Lutemann</a>) on Youtube.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.justinguitar.com/">Justin Guitar</a> - If you don’t want to be limited to classical music, this is the site. Blues, Rock and Jazz.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pjalan">Pawan Jalan's channel on Youtube</a> - For those who want to play Hindi Bollywood songs.</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- h1>Tabulatures for practice</h1>
		<p>These are the tabs that I wrote down using Tuxguitar. You can import them directly in Guitar Pro.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>An example of “Reflections on Trusting trust” sorta program.<br>
			&mdash; does nothing, except prints out the source code again :) in C</p>
			<p>» <a href="trusting_trust.c">trusting_trust.c</a> «</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>The source code for blogs and comments in PHP 4. This ZIP file contains: blog.php (for showing blogs), blog.xml (sample blogs), blog.xsd (you may omit this, but is just there for standard compliance), comment.php (for showing and submitting comments), recaptchalib.php (for reCAPTCHA spam protection) and xml_read.php (needed for parsing XML). If you have any other questions, mail me.<br>
			<br>To test the whole show, you will need to create a empty database in MySQL and modify blog.php and comment.php accordingly (you need to specify username and password, as well as database name). If you want to have reCAPTCHA, you need to register their and modify comment.php. That is all you need to do :)<br>
			&mdash; the text file contains blog.php, comment.php, sample blog.xml and blog.xsd</p>
