<h3>Idiotic</h3>
<ul>
<li><q>McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty Bag filled with vegetable soup.</q><br>
<li><q>Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze.</q><br>
<li><q>Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center.</q><br>
<li><q>Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.</q><br>
<li><q>He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree.</q><br>
<li><q>Her date was pleasant enough, but she knew that if her life was a movie this guy would be buried in the credits as something like "Second Tall Man."</q><br>
<li><q>The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the period after the Dr. on a Dr Pepper can.</q><br>
<li><q>They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled Nancy Kerrigan&rsquo;s teeth</q><br>
<li><q>John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met.</q><br>
<li><q>The thunder was ominous-sounding, much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play.</q><br>
<li><q>The red brick wall was the color of a brick-red Crayola crayon.</q><br>
</ul>

<h3>Misc.</h3>
<ul>
<li><q>The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy is working.</q><br>
<li><q>Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it worrying about the future?</q><br>
<li><q>Who can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I&rsquo;ll find someone.</q><br>
<li><q>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.</q><br>
<li><q>False hope is nicer than no hope at all.</q><br>
<li><q>Does my quiet self-pity get to me? Yes? Or should I move up to incessant nagging?</q><br>
<li><q>Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with imaginary fears.</q><br>
<li><q>The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do nice things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.</q><br>
<li><q>As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward me in many ways to keep me quiet.</q><br>
<li><q>I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and complain.</q><br>
<li><q>I am grateful that I am not as judgemental as all those censorious, self-righteous people around me.</q><br>
<li><q>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no personality at all.</q><br>
<li><q>I can change any thought that hurts into a reality that hurts even more.</q><br>
<li><q>Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over others.</q><br>
<li><q>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are someone else&rsquo;s fault.</q><br>
<li><q>Murphy&rsquo;s First Law for Wives: If you ask your husband to pick up five items at the store and then you add one more as an afterthought, he will forget two of the first five.</q><br>
<li><q>Kauffman&rsquo;s Paradox of the Corporation: The less important you are to the corporation, the more your tardiness or absence is noticed.</q><br>
<li><q>The Salary Axiom: The pay raise is just large enough to increase your taxes and just small enough to have no effect on your take-home pay.</q><br>
<li><q>Miller&rsquo;s Law of Insurance: Insurance covers everything except what happens.</q><br>
<li><q>First Law of Living: As soon as you start doing what you always wanted to be doing, you&rsquo;ll want to be doing something else.</q><br>
<li><q>Weiner&rsquo;s Law of Libraries: There are no answers, only cross-references.</q><br>
<li><q>Isaac&rsquo;s Strange Rule of Staleness: Any food that starts out hard will soften when stale. Any food that starts out soft will harden when stale.</q><br>
<li><q>The Grocery Bag Law: The candy bar you planned to eat on the way home from the market is hidden at the bottom of the grocery bag.</q><br>
<li><q>Lampner&rsquo;s Law of Employment: When leaving work late, you will go unnoticed. When you leave work early, you will meet the boss in the parking lot.</q><br>
<li><q>[Isaac Newton falls off the tree] Cho-Cho: Did the fall hurt you? Newton: It wasn&rsquo;t the fall; it was the sudden stop at the end.</q><br>
<li><q>Subtlety is the art of saying what you think and getting out of the way before it is understood.</q><br>
<li><q>I don&rsquo;t want to die like my grandfather. He died in a nazi concentration camp. He fell off a guard tower. :-(</q><br>
<li><q>I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather... not yelling and screaming like the passengers in his car.</q><br>
<li><q>When you don&rsquo;t know what to do, walk fast and look worried.</q><br>

<h3>Sarcasm</h3>
<ul>
<li><q>Don&rsquo;t blame me! I&rsquo;m Jewish!</q> &mdash; <em>Jesus</em><br>
<li><q>Do not change your behavior. I simply have to forgive you. It&rsquo;s less paperwork.</q> &mdash; <em>Jesus</em><br>
<li><q>Folks, the point of life is to memorize and believe in the events that took place in my life. As long as you know that I rose from the dead, you can actually forget about most of that &lsquo;Love thy neighbor&rsquo; talk. I mean...I freakin&rsquo; rose from the dead. How cool is that?</q><br>

<li><q>I think I've figured this balloon thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side or back in time.</q><br>
